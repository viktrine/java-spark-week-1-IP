# Description
This program is an implementation of shift of letters through a number of positions called key. Given a letter and a key, shifting the letter key number of times either to left or right will yield a different letter and thus encoding.
The opposite is also true where you unshift the letters key number of times on the opposite direction to the earlier shift.
